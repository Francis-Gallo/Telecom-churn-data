📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Segmentation

This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry to identify key factors contributing to churn and to support data-driven retention strategies.
The work combines data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, clustering, and visualization to extract actionable business insights.

🎯 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom providers, directly impacting revenue and growth.
The objective of this project is to:

Understand why customers churn

Identify high-risk customer segments

Provide insights that can guide targeted retention strategies

📂 Dataset Overview

7,043 customer records

Features include:

Customer demographics

Service usage and subscriptions

Billing and contract information

Churn label (Yes / No)

Data Preparation

Cleaned and validated raw data

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Transformed categorical variables

Prepared datasets for analysis, clustering, and visualization

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key churn trends were analyzed using visual and statistical techniques:

Churn rate by contract type

Relationship between monthly charges and churn

Impact of tenure and demographics

Service-level patterns influencing customer retention

These insights highlighted strong correlations between short-term contracts, high billing amounts, and churn risk.

🧠 Modeling & Segmentation
🔹 K-Means Clustering

Customer segmentation was performed to uncover distinct behavioral patterns:

Grouped customers based on service usage and billing characteristics

Identified high-risk churn segments

Enabled interpretation of churn behavior beyond binary classification

Clustering results support personalized retention strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches.

📈 Key Findings

Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit significantly higher churn

Higher monthly charges correlate strongly with churn probability

Clustering reveals distinct customer segments with varying churn risk profiles

Data-driven segmentation enables more targeted and cost-effective retention actions
